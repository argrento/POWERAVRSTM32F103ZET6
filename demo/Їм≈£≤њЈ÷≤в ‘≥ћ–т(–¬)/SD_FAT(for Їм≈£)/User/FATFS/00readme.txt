FatFs/Tiny-FatFs Module Source Files R0.06                  (C)ChaN, 2008


FILES

  ff.h       Common include file for FatFs and application module.
  ff.c       FatFs module.
  tff.h      Common include file for Tiny-FatFs and application module.
  tff.c      Tiny-FatFs module.
  diskio.h   Common include file for (Tiny-)FatFs and disk I/O module.
  diskio.c   Skeleton of low level disk I/O module.
  integer.h  Alternative type definitions for integer variables.

  Low level disk I/O module is not included in this archive because the
  FatFs/Tiny-FatFs module is only a generic file system layer and not depend
  on any specific storage device. You have to provide a low level disk I/O
  module that written to control your storage device.



CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

  There are several configuration options for various envilonment and
  requirement. The configuration options are defined in header files, ff.h
  and tff.h.

  _MCU_ENDIAN

  This is the most impotant option that depends on the processor architecture.
  The value 2 is compatible with all MCUs. It forces FatFs to access FAT
  structures in byte-by-byte. When the target device corresponds to either or
  both of following cases, it must always be set 2.

  - Muti-byte integers (short, long) are stored in Big-Endian.
  - Address miss-aligned memory access results in an incorrect behavior.

  If not the case, setting 1 is recommended rather than 2 for good code
  efficiency. The initial value is 0. (Must set 1 or 2 properly)


  _FS_READONLY

  When application program does not require write functions, _FS_READONLY can
  be set to 1 to eliminate writing code to reduce the module size. This
  setting should be reflected to configurations of low level disk I/O module
  if available. The initial value is 0. (Read and Write)


  _FS_MINIMIZE

  When application program requires only file read/write function and nothing
  else, _FS_MINIMIZE can be changed to eliminate some functions to reduce the
  module size. The initial value is 0. (Full function)


  _USE_STRFUNC

  When _USE_STRFUNC is set to 1, the string functions, fputc, fputs, fprintf
  and fgets are enabled. The initial value is 0. (String functions are not
  available)


  _DRIVES

  Number of drives to be used. This option is not available on Tiny-FatFs.
  The initial value is 2.

  _FAT32

  When _FAT32 is set to 1, the FAT32 support is added with an additional
  code size. This option is for only Tiny-FatFs. FatFs always supports all
  FAT sub-types. The initial value is 0. (No FAT32 support)


  _USE_FSINFO

  When _USE_FSINFO is set to 1, FSInfo is used for FAT32 volume. The initial
  value is 0. (FSInfo is not used)

  _USE_SJIS

  When _USE_SJIS is set to 1, Shift_JIS code set can be used as a file name,
  otherwire second byte of double-byte characters will be collapted. The
  initial value is 1.


  _USE_NTFLAG

  When _USE_NTFLAG is set to 1, upper/lower case of the file/dir name is
  preserved. Note that the files are always accessed in case insensitive.
  The initial value is 1.


  _USE_MKFS

  When _USE_MKFS is set to 1 and _FS_READONLY is set to 0, f_mkfs function
  is enabled. This is for only FatFs module and not supported on Tiny-FatFs.
  The initial value is 0. (f_mkfs is not available)


  Following table shows which function is removed by configuration options.
